<P class="p58 ft22"id="zero"><SPAN class="ft51">(b)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft54">Notifying the installer of any particular features which you know about the property which may make the installation more difficult than expected. We will assume that your property is not subject to any listing and that the installation works will not contravene any planning conditions or obligations unless you tell us otherwise. </SPAN><SPAN class="ft53">Further we assume that your premises are free from damp, dry rot, infestation or collapse and are otherwise structurally suitable to accept the installation of the products.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p59 ft22"id="zero"><SPAN class="ft51">(c)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft55">Ensuring that existing wiring, gas, water and waste pipework within the property is generally of a legal and good </SPAN><NOBR>workman-like</NOBR> standard. In particular, you acknowledge that you have checked the walls and floors are sound. You are responsible for locating any hidden wiring or pipework and the installer shall not be liable for any damage caused by or in connection with any hidden conduits.</P>
<P class="p60 ft22"id="zero"><SPAN class="ft51">(d)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft54">Checking that any appliance, accessory or component supplied by yourself is suitable for use with the products. For example, if you decided to retain your own taps, you would need to make sure they are compatible with your new kitchen/bathroom suite.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p60 ft22"id="zero"><SPAN class="ft2">(e)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft54">Removing all moveable items from the room where the installation is to be carried out, and for cleaning and preparing and protecting all surfaces prior to the arrival of the installer. The installer may reasonably refuse to start work where this has not been done and you will be responsible for any delays (and the cost of any such delays) which arise as a result.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p60 ft22"id="zero"><SPAN class="ft20">(f)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft56">Removing any asbestos insulation board or asbestos coating. Throughout the installation you are responsible for giving the installer reasonable access to your property in order that installation works can be completed.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p61 ft57"id="zero">We may terminate the contract and reserve the right to bring a claim against you for in the event that the installation is not possible or impractical due to circumstances reasonably within your control or knowledge. <SPAN class="ft44">You are advised not to decorate rooms prior to installation (including the tiling of walls or the laying of new floors) except the space where front frame furniture is to be installed in order to avoid minor incidental damage caused during installation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<DIV id="page_8" class="mt-0">


<DIV id="id8_1">
<P class="p62 ft58"id="zero">Redecoration of rooms shall be your responsibility and it is not included in the price agreed unless specifically set out otherwise.</P>
<P class="p63 ft53"id="zero">For the avoidance of doubt, this provision does not exclude our responsibility for damage which is beyond what is reasonably commensurate with the fitting of the kitchen/bathroom in the usual way (for example, damage to other areas of the premises where the products are not being fitted) or which has been caused by the negligence of us or our agents. <SPAN class="ft22">We will do our best to procure that installations are started on the date agreed between you and the installer. However, the start date and completion dates that we give you are guides. Whilst we make every effort to install the items within that time, we shall not be liable if we fail to do so in part or in full due to circumstances beyond our control. </SPAN>We will do all we reasonably can to ensure that the price quoted to you for the installation is accurately stated but you understand that kitchen/bathroom products are “made to measure”.</P>
<P class="p64 ft53"id="zero">We will therefore, arrange for a representative to visit your premises to check suitability for installation and complete a <NOBR>pre-fit</NOBR> survey. Please understand that although our representative is trained and experienced in installation requirements, he/she is not a building surveyor (or similar), is not qualified to detect latent defects or unusual structural problems, and will not carry out any opening up or intrusive testing. If, following such an assessment, or at any time up until completion of the installation, it becomes apparent that the installation has been under priced due to</P>
<P class="p65 ft58"id="zero"><SPAN class="ft58">(i)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft59">a technical reason beyond the reasonable expectation of the installer or</SPAN></P>
<P class="p66 ft53"id="zero"><SPAN class="ft58">(ii)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft60">an inadvertent error in information provided by you to us with regard to the premises (and in particular to the services and drainage available on those premises), or is impractical, then we will inform you of such, providing a written explanation and wherever reasonably possible a detailed specification and price variation proposal and both parties will attempt to agree a revised price for the installation.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p63 ft53"id="zero">In the event that a revised price cannot be agreed then either party is entitled to terminate the contract whereupon any monies paid by you will be refunded in full subject to a deduction for the reasonable costs of materials and services provided by us up to the point of termination. We may make minor</P>

<DIV id="page_9" class="mt-0">


<DIV id="id9_1">
<P class="p62 ft57"id="zero">modifications to the specifications for practical purposes provided that such modifications do not materially affect the appearance and/or design of the kitchen/bathroom and the quality or standard of the products. You acknowledge the inevitability of some disruption in the use of the kitchen whilst the products are being installed and whilst we shall not be liable for such disruption, we shall take reasonable steps to minimise such disruption. <SPAN class="ft44">You further acknowledge that you may be prevented from using certain facilities during the installation such as sinks, basins, baths and w/cs.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p67 ft22"id="zero">We will do our best to ensure that the installer performs the services with due care and skill and observes all health and safety rules. Furthermore, we will carry out checks to ensure that they are suitably qualified to carry out the installation.</P>
<P class="p68 ft22"id="zero">The Customer is solely responsible for ensuring that the site is suitably prepared for installation. In the event that damp or dry rot is detected during the template the Company recommends that the condition be treated well in advance of the agreed date for delivery and installation of the Product(s). Electrical and telephone points, utensil racks, appliances, cabinetry and all fixtures must be fitted or marked before the template, as changes cannot be made to the Product(s) once it is cut and toughened. Painter’s caulk is applied to outer perimeter of the Product(s) for sealing and waterproofing purposes. Seals may vary depending on joinery, walls and worktops being level or plumb. Up to 5mm tolerances are acceptable. If the Company is not installing the Product(s), silicone must be purchased from the Company and installation should be carried out using recommended products.</P>
<P class="p64 ft22"id="zero">The Company strongly recommends that the Customer’s own surveyors and fitters be sent to the Company for two (2) days training before attempting to install the Product(s). The Company shall not be responsible for any issues relating to the size or fit of the Product(s) if</P>
<P class="p69 ft22"id="zero"><SPAN class="ft51">(a)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft56">the Product(s) are ordered without the benefit of a template by the Company’s qualified installers or</SPAN></P>
<P class="p12 ft2"id="zero"><SPAN class="ft20">(b)</SPAN><SPAN class="ft61">the Product(s) are installed by unqualified installers.</SPAN></P>

<DIV id="id10_1">
<P class="p13 ft19"id="zero"><SPAN class="ft17">XII. </SPAN>COLOR OF OPTIONAL GLASS SPLASHBACK</P>
<P class="p20 ft2"id="zero">Colour is to be chosen from the Company’s standard range, from the Dulux, RAL, Pantone, Farrow & Ball or WCP paint mixing range or a colour match at extra cost. Due to the variation in the manufacture of glass the colours as shown on the colour chart or sample cannot be guaranteed. The Company will use its reasonable endeavours to match as closely as possible the finished Product with the colour chart, however the Customer is advised that it is difficult to match a printed colour chart with the Company’s paint. Certain glass types other than Low Iron (“Opticlear”) have a higher content of iron in them which causes a green effect that changes the final colour of the colour coat. Please refer to the coloured glass samples for a more accurate indication. The colours on samples are slightly lighter than the finished product as samples allow more light through the edge of the glass thus making the colour lighter. Colours should always be chosen from sample swatches in the room set under final lighting conditions. The companies samples are chargeable However upon request the company reserves the right to provide a sample for a disclosed fee.</P>
<P class="p70 ft19"id="zero"><SPAN class="ft17">XIII. </SPAN>PRODUCT CARE FOR OPTIONAL GLASS SPLASHBACKS</P>
<P class="p20 ft22"id="zero">It is the responsibility of the Customer to follow manufacturer’s instructions and to treat the Products with due care and attention, as no responsibility can be accepted by the Company for damage caused by incorrect use or cleaning with products that contain bleach or other corrosive agents. Glass should be cleaned with glass cleaning products or disinfectant. It is the client’s responsibility to clean, maintain and display the Colour Coated glass to a high standard. The display should not be obstructed at any time by fittings, deliveries, furniture, promotional material etc. Any faults found should be reported and the Company will put right anything found to be faulty. However if willful damage or neglect is detected we reserve the right to charge the client. The Company will supply all necessary point of sale material when needed and of good quality. The client should inform the Company well in advance when stocks are becoming low.</P>
